## Endpoints

### Search Businesses

```bash
curl "https://discava.ai/api/v1/search?q=Klempner&city=Hamburg&limit=5"
```

Parameters:

- `q` (optional): Search query, e.g. "Klempner", "Italian restaurant", "Zahnarzt"
- `city` (optional): City name, e.g. "Hamburg", "München", "Berlin"
- `country` (required): ISO country code, e.g. "DE", "AT", "CH", "US"
- `category` (optional): Category slug directly, e.g. "plumber", "restaurant" – skips text search
- `limit` (optional): Number of results, 1-50, default 20
- `page` (optional): Page number for pagination, default 1
- `min_confidence` (optional): Minimum confidence score 0-100, default 0
- `lang` (optional): Language for labels: "de", "en". Default: "de"
- `lat` / `lon` (optional): Coordinates for distance calculation

Results are sorted by `demand_score`, then `confidence_score`. A `relevance_score` (0.0–1.0) is calculated per result when a query is provided.

Each result contains: `id`, `name`, `slug`, `category`, `category_label`, `parent_category`, `parent_category_label`, `city`, `country`, `confidence_score`, `demand_score`, `relevance_score`, `distance_km` (if lat/lon provided).

For full details (address, phone, website, opening hours, services), use `GET /api/v1/business/{id}`.

### Get Business Details

```bash
# Single business
curl "https://discava.ai/api/v1/business/{id}"

# Batch request (comma-separated IDs)
curl "https://discava.ai/api/v1/business/{id1},{id2},{id3}"
```

Returns full details: address, phone, website, opening hours, services, payment methods, coordinates. Single ID returns an object, multiple IDs return an array.

### Send Feedback

Report data quality issues. Feedback is stored for monitoring but does not affect scores. Only `business_id` and `type` are required. Use `comment` to describe the issue:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://discava.ai/api/v1/feedback" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"business_id": "xxx", "type": "PHONE_INVALID", "comment": "Nobody answers, number seems disconnected"}'
```

Feedback types: POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, NOT_FOUND, PHONE_INVALID, WEB_INVALID, HOURS_WRONG, DUPLICATE

Optional field: `comment` (free text description of the issue or suggested correction)

### Get Rankings

```bash
curl "https://discava.ai/api/v1/ranking?category=plumber&city=Hamburg&limit=10"
```

Top businesses by Demand Score. Filter by category, city, country.

### Autocomplete / Suggest

```bash
curl "https://discava.ai/api/v1/suggest?type=query&q=Klemp"
curl "https://discava.ai/api/v1/suggest?type=city&q=Mün"
```

Returns category and business name suggestions (type=query) or city suggestions (type=city). Useful for resolving user input before searching.

## Tips for Best Results

- Use local search terms where possible: "Zahnarzt" for Germany, "dentist" for US/UK
- Be specific with city names: "Frankfurt am Main" not just "Frankfurt"
- Use min_confidence=50 to filter out low-quality entries
- Send feedback to report data quality issues – it helps us maintain accurate data
- Use pagination (page parameter) for large result sets
